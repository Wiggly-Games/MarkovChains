just a little bitty boy living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement half a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shop","You know the place","well anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy","Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning","My mother would make me a big bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast","Awww - Big bowl of sauerkraut","Every single mornin","It wa driving me crazy","I said to my mom","I said \"Hey, mom, what's with all the sauerkraut?\"","And my dear, sweet mother","She just looked at my like a cow looks at an oncoming train","And she leaned right down next to me","And she said \"IT'S GOOD FOR YOU\"","And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth","And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old","That's when I swore that someday","Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place","Where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer","And the towels are oh so fluffy","Where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long","And anyone on the street will glady shave your back for a nickel","Wacka wacka doodoo yeah","Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true","Because the very next day, a local radio station had this contest","To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt","I was off by three, but I still won the grand prize","That's right, a first class one-way ticket to","Albuquerque","Albuquerque","Oh yeah","You know, I'd never been on a real airplane before","And I gotta tell ya, it was really great","Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor","And the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time","The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts","And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore","And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out","And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside","And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died","Except for me","You know why?","'Cause I had my tray table up","And my seat back in the full upright position","Had my tray table up","And my seat back in the full upright position","Had my tray table up","And my seat back in the full upright position","Ah ha ha ha","Ah ha ha","Ahhhh","So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage","I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days","Draggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag","And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball","And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel","But finally I arived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn","Where the towels are oh so fluffy","And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna","It's OK, they're clean","Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C","And I turned on the SpectraVision","And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow","That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door","Well now, who could that be?","I say \"Who is it?\"","No answer","\"Who is it?\"","There's no answer","\"WHO IS IT?\"","They're not sayin' anything","So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected","It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril","Oh man, I hate it when I'm right","So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel","And I'm like \"Hey, you can't have that\"","\"That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me\"","And he's like \"Tough\"","And I'm like \"Give it\"","And he's like \"Make me\"","And I'm like \"'Kay\"","So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus","And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows","And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation","Yes indeed, you better believe it","And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook","And twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice","And you know what it said?","I'll tell you what it said","It said","\"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again\"","\"If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator\"","\"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again\"","\"If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator\"","In Albuquerque","Albuquerque","Well, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel","But I made a a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest","I would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice","But first, I decided to buy some donuts","So I got in my car and I drove over to the donut shop","And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter","And he says \"Yeah, what do ya want?\"","I said \"You got any glazed donuts?\"","He said \"No, we're outta glazed donuts\"","I said \"You got any jelly donuts?\"","He said \"No, we're outta jelly donuts\"","I said \"You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?\"","He said \"No, we're outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts\"","I said \"You got any cinnamon rolls?\"","He said \"No, we're outta cinnamon rolls\"","I said \"You got any apple fritters?\"","He said \"No, we're outta apple fritters\"","I said \"You got any bear claws?\"","He said \"Wait a minute, I'll go check\"","\"No, we're outta bear claws\"","I said \"Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?\"","He says \"All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels\"","I said \"OK, I'll take that\"","So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out","And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over","(rabid gnawing sounds)","Oh man, they were just going nuts","They were tearin' me apart","You know, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin' through my head\"","I believe it went a little something like this . . .","Doh","Get 'em off me","Get 'em off me","Oh","No, get 'em off, get 'em off","Oh, oh God, oh God","Oh, get 'em off me","Oh, oh God","Ah, (more screaming)","I ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face","Wavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'","Like a constipated wiener dog","And as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams","Her name was Zelda","She was a calligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches","I'll never forget the first thing she said to me.","She said \"Hey, you've got weasels on your face\"","That's when I knew it was true love","We were inseperable after that","Aw, we ate together, we bathed together","We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss","The world was our burrito","So we got married and we bought us a house","And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly","Oh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah","But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me","She said \"Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?\"","I said \"Woah, hold on now, baby\"","\"I'm just not ready for that kinda commitment\"","So we broke up and I never saw her again","But that's just the way things go","In Albuquerque","Albuquerque","Anyway, things really started lookin' upi for me","Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream","That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler","I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face","Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that","I was gettin' a lot of attitude","OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot","Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil","When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself","So I, I say to him, I say \"Hey, you want me to help you with that?\"","And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes","\"No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw\"","So I did","And then he gets all indignant on me","He's like \"Hey man, I was just being sarcastic\"","Well, that's just great","How was I supposed to know that?","I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud","Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy","So what's he complaining about?","Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote","This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bit in three days","Well, I knew what he meant","But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein","And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over","And I'm like \"Hey, come on, don'tcha get it?\"","But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming","(screaming sounds)","You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation","Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know?","Anyway, um, um, where was I?","Kinda lost my train of thought","Uh, well, uh, OK","Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it","But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is","I hate sauerkraut","That's all I'm really tryin' to say","And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up","And find yourself in an existential quandry","Full of loathing and self-doubt","And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence","At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that","Somewhere out there in this crazy ol' mixed-up universe of ours","There's still a little place called","Albuquerque","Albuquerque","Albuquerque, Albuquerque","Albuquerque, Albuquerque","Albuquerque, Albuquerque","Albuquerque, Albuquerque","I said \"A\" (A)","\"L\" (L)","\"B\" (B)","\"U\" (U)","\"querque\" (querque)","Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque","Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque","Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque","Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque","Albuquerque","Here she come now, wants her alimony.","Bleedin' me dry as a bony bony.","Work at three jobs just to stay in debt now.","Well first she took my nest egg, then she took the nest.","I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.","'Cause she took my house...my car,","My shoes...and my toothbrush too.","Too bad...so sad.","A-she got...got the gift of grab.","I'm in debt, debt, debt, debt, debt, debt.","Lawyer's callin' me on the telephony.","Tryin'-a squeeze-a blood from a stony stony.","Ooh, I took her for better or for worse, yeah.","Then she took me for everything, yeah everything","She could get, get, get, get, get.","Well I'm out of cash...no dough.","I'm broke...it's no joke.","The check's in the mail...get off","My back...cut me some slack.","I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.","(Ooh, I want my almo-mo-mony)  Oh you do?","(Ooh, I want my almo-mo-mony)  Is it due?","(Ooh, I want my almo-mo-mony)  Or you'll sue?","(Ooh, I want my almo-mo-mony)","Alimony, mony, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.","","Joe Franklin (Joe Franklin)","You're my reason for living (Yeah, Joe)","You're the one and only Franklin in my life","Except for Bob Franklin, who was in my","Biology class in high school","Oh, Joe Franklin (Joe Franklin)","I know I couldn't live without you (Yeah Joe)","If I couldn't watch your program, I'd just shrivel up and die","And the maggots would eat my brain (Eat my brain) (Yeah)","Mr. Franklin, you mean so very very much to me","Words simply can't describe you that well","But if I had to choose- if I had to choose an adjective, oh gosh, Joe,","I'd have to say you're swell (Yeah)","Hey Joe (Hey Joe)","Where you going with that gun in your hand (Silly Joe)","I'll bet you'd bet there's no-one in the world","Who can do the Joe Franklin show","Like you (oo) (oo) (oo) (oo)","As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain","I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain","But that's just perfect for an Amish like me","You know, I shun fancy things like electricity","At 4:30 in the morning I'm milkin' cows","Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows... fool","And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that","Even Ezekiel things that my mind is gone","I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline","Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin","But if I finish all of my chores and you finish thine","Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699","We've been spending most our lives","Living in an Amish paradise","I churn butter once or twice","Living in an Amish paradise","It's hard work and sacrifice","Living in an Amish paradise","We sell quilts at discount price","Living in an Amish paradise","A local boy kicked me in the butt last week","I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek","I really don't care, in fact I wish him well","'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in hell","But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it","An Amish with a 'tude?
